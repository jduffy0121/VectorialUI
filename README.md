# VectorialUI

## Program Information
*A UI Interface created by Auburn University's AMO Physics Research Group.*  
  
This program looks at cometary data regarding particles that radiate from the coma of the comet before and after coliding with a photon.  
A vectorial model is used to calculate this data (all found in pyvectorial).   
This UI allows users to **manually input** data, use a **pickle file**, or use a **yaml file** to run the calculations contained in pyvectorial.  
This package is avaible for anyone to download.
